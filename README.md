# React-Events

This is my attempt at a client-side-only app to browse and explore public Facebook event data. 
It’s currently just a playground for learning various build tools, best practices, and technologies.

So far, this project uses (or used): 
  - Typescript
  - Webpack
  - Jsx / React
  - Redux
  - Brunch (removed)
  - Babel (removed)

## Installation
```sh
npm install
npm start # spawns a dev server
echo “go get it”
```
